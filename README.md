## Configuration

### Default Configuration

By default, the script uses the following files and settings:

* **Package File**: `alpiList`
  The script will read package names from this file, one per line. If no file is specified, this file will be used.

* **Configuration File**: `alpiConf`
  The script uses this file to configure its environment. You can override these setting using the `-C` option.

* **Log File**: `alpiLog`
  Logs for all script actions are written to this file. You can review it for debugging or record-keeping.

### Custom Configuration

You can create a custom configuration file for your needs. The configuration file should contain key-value pairs to define environment variables, package lists, or other settings that the script will use.

Example configuration:

```bash
DEFAULT_PACKAGE_FILE="<File Path>"
LOG_FILE="<File Path>"
LOCK_FILE="<File Path>"
```

---

## Logging

All actions performed by the app are logged for accountability and debugging purposes. The default log file is defined by the `$LOG_FILE` variable, but you can customize it.

* **Log Format**: Each log entry includes the action taken, and any relevant output or errors.

* **Location**: The default location for logs is `$LOG_FILE`. To specify a custom log file, use the `-v` option, and modify the `$LOG_FILE` in the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the script, here are some common solutions:

* **Permissions Issues**

  * Ensure you have the necessary privileges to perform package management tasks. Use `sudo` if required.

```bash
sudo alpi
```

* **Missing Dependencies**

  * If you see errors related to missing dependencies, make sure your package manager is set up correctly, and the package names are valid.

* **File Not Found Errors**

  * Ensure that your package list file and configuration file paths are correct. You can verify the paths by checking the environment variables `-v` or using the `-f` and `-C` options.

* **Log Review**

  * Review the logs in `alpiLog` to check for any specific error messages or warnings that could help diagnose the issue.
